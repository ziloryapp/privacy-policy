    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Our app does not collect sensitive personal information such as name, email, or address directly. However, we use third-party services that may collect limited information for functionality, analytics, advertising, and subscription management:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AdMob</strong> (Google) – for showing ads and measuring their performance. This may include device identifiers (such as IDFA) for personalized ads.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase Analytics & Performance</strong> – to understand app usage, improve performance, and fix issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> – to collect crash logs and improve stability.</li>
      <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> – to manage in-app purchases, subscriptions, and to process refund requests.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. In-App Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Payments are processed securely through the Apple App Store. We do not access or store payment details. Purchase history may be processed by RevenueCat to unlock features, validate subscriptions, and manage refunds.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Tracking Transparency (ATT)</h2>
    <p>On iOS devices, the app may request your permission through Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework to use the device identifier (IDFA) for personalized ads. You can allow or deny this request, and you can change your choice anytime in your device settings.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Refund Handling</h2>
    <p>When a refund request is made, RevenueCat may share your consumption data (e.g., whether you used the purchased feature) with Apple to help them decide on the refund. This is done in compliance with Apple’s guidelines and only for refund evaluation purposes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>The collected data is used only for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improving app features and stability</li>
      <li>Analyzing app performance and user engagement</li>
      <li>Providing and personalizing advertisements</li>
      <li>Managing purchases, subscriptions, and refunds</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>

      <li>Request correction or deletion of your data</li>
