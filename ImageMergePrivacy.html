    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>This app does not directly collect your sensitive personal information, such as email or location. However, we use third-party services to analyze app usage and provide advertising or purchase support, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Analytics</li>
      <li>Firebase</li>
      <li>AdMob</li>
      <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> (subscription management, receipt validation, refund processing)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services may collect device information, usage data, and advertising identifiers (such as IDFA), and—where applicable—transaction metadata (e.g., purchase receipts and subscription status) to provide their services. We do not receive or store your full payment card details.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="purchases">
    <h2>2. In-App Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>This app offers in-app purchases and subscription services. Purchase information is processed through the Apple App Store, and we do not directly collect payment information.</p>
    <p>We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to securely manage in-app purchases, subscriptions, and refund requests. RevenueCat may receive purchase receipts and subscription status from Apple in order to provide subscription validation and refund processing. Refund-related usage data may also be shared with Apple via RevenueCat to help Apple make informed refund decisions.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="data-use">
    <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>The collected data is used only for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improving app features and performance</li>
      <li>Analyzing user behavior to optimize experience</li>
      <li>Providing personalized advertising services</li>
      <li>Validating purchases and managing subscriptions</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="refunds">
    <h2>4. Refund Requests & Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      When you request a refund for an in-app purchase, we may share anonymized data about your usage
      and consumption of the purchased content with Apple. This allows Apple to make an informed
      decision regarding refund requests. Such data may include how you accessed and interacted with
      the purchased content, but does not contain personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    <p>
      By making in-app purchases, you consent to this data sharing process, which is conducted
      strictly in compliance with Apple's policies and only as necessary to process refund requests.
    </p>
